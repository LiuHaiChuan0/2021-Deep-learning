Training log for balanced AudioSet-20k set. Pretrained model is [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/u5i5v0bej24l47p/audioset_bal_10_10_0.3499.pth?dl=1), it has 0.3499 mAP. This is to help reproducing this work easier, the model trained with full-AudioSet is also released and is much stronger. Note for the balanced set, we use the [enhanced label set proposed in our PSLA paper](https://github.com/YuanGongND/psla#Pretrained-Enhanced-Label-Sets), which is also publicly available.
